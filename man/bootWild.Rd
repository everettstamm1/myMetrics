\usage{
bootWild(
  dependent,
  independents,
  repetitions,
  hypothesisColumn,
  hypothesisValue,
  rv,
  transform = TRUE,
  suppressConstant = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{independents}{matrix of independent variable(s), do not include constant term.}

\item{repetitions}{number of bootstrap repetitions to be performed}

\item{hypothesisColumn}{column index in 'independents' of which coefficient restriction will be tested}

\item{hypothesisValue}{hypothesized value of the coefficient of hypothesisColumn, numeric}

\item{rv}{Distribution of random variable (with mean 0 and variance 1) to multiply the residuals by. Acceptable types are 'mammen', 'rademacher', and 'standard normal'.}

\item{transform}{Whether or not to transform the t-th residual by 1/(1-ht)^.5, where ht is the t-th diagonal of the hat matrix \code{X((X^t*X)^-1)*X^t}.
This is typically done when some observations have high leverage.}

\item{suppressConstant}{logical. If true, there will be no constant term added to the regression. Defaults to false.}

\item{dependents}{numeric vector of dependent variable}
}
\value{
A character string detailing the resulting p-value of the test.
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of a dependent variable, a vector of a single independent variable or a list of
several independent variables, a number of bootstrap repetitions, a hypothesis, and a option to rescale the residuals
and performs restricted residual resampling. To learn more about the theory, please read section 3.4 of "Bootstrap Methods
in Econometrics" by James A. MacKinnon, Queenâ€™s Economics Department Working Paper No. 1028, 2006.
