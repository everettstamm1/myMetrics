\title{Non-Parametric Restricted Residual Resampling Bootstrap}
\usage{
bootNonParametric(
  Dependent,
  Independents,
  Repetitions,
  Hypothesis,
  rescale = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Independents}{numeric vector or list of numeric vectors of independent variable(s)}

\item{Repetitions}{number of bootstrap repetitions to be performed}

\item{Hypothesis}{Linear restriction to be tested, must be of the format "Xi = h" where the i-th vector in the Independent
list of vectors is the variable you wish to test a restriction on and h is the restriction. Note: if you have multiple digits of independent variables,
you must enter the hypothesis with all digits, i.e. if you have 100 independent variables and you wish to test a restriction on
the 3-rd vector in the Independent list of vectors, your hypothesis should be written "X003 = h", rather than "X3 = h".}

\item{rescale}{Whether or not to rescale the residuals by (n/(n-k))^.5. This is typically done to ensure residuals have correct variance.}

\item{Dependents}{numeric vector of dependent variable}
}
\value{
A character string detailing the resulting p-value of the test.
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of a dependent variable, a vector of a single independent variable or a list of
several independent variables, a number of bootstrap repetitions, a hypothesis, and a option to rescale the residuals
and performs restricted residual resampling. To learn more about the theory, please read section 3.1 of "Bootstrap Methods
in Econometrics" by James A. MacKinnon, Queenâ€™s Economics Department Working Paper No. 1028, 2006.
